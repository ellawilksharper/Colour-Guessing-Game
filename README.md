# Colour Guessing Game

This is the first game I've made using vanilla Javascript. Below are instructions on how to play: 

<u>What's RGB colours?</u>

It's a colour system that combines Red, Green and Blue. Each value can go up to 255. 

- Red = rgb(255, 0, 0)
- Green = rgb(0, 255, 0)
- Blue = rgb(0, 0, 255)

<u>How to play</u> 

The title will display a randomly selected rgb colour. Choose either easy (3 squares) or hard (6 squares) mode. 

Then click on the square that you think matches the title rgb. Keep clicking until you find the right one. Then click new colours to restart the game.
